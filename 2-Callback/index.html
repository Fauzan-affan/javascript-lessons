      <h4>What the hell is callback?</h4>
      <p>Callback is actually a function, the difference with a function in general is the way of execution. If a function is generally executed sequentially from top to bottom, the callback is executed at a certain point, that's why it's called a callback.</p>
      <p>Callbacks are also called <a href="https://dev.to/damcosset/higher-order-functions-in-javascript-4j8b">high-order functions</a>. Callbacks are actually functions, the difference with functions in general is the way they are executed. If a function is generally executed directly while a <b>callback is executed in another function via parameters.</b></p>
